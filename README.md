# CS Concept Case Studies
Stores work completed on concept case studies, such as tutorials, tool testing, and general learning exercises. Much of the work may be copied directly from blogs and nline tutorials. This is meant to be a collection for future recall, not a publication. I will do my best to include links to all sources of code and information.
